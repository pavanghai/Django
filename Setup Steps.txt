# This is steps to use Django in CMD lakshit@agamasolutions.com
Step 1 Creating Virtual Environment
	once u r in directory where you want to create vertual Environment
	cmd in search bar
	cd Pavan\Python\Codes
	py -m venv django  # django is the Virtual Environment
	django\scripts\activate # this is to activate Newly created Virtual Environment
	
	'''
	Command prompt will look like
	(django) e:\Pavan\Python\Codes>
	'''
	'''
	django\scripts\deactivate # to move out of Virtual Environment
	'''
Step 2 Install Packages (Django)
	
	pip install django # this is to install Django in Virtual Environment
	
	
Step 3 Create a project
	
	django-admin startproject myproject # myproject is the newly create project, we can give any name, Can be seen in folder
	cd myproject # to be in newly created project
Step 4 Create Database	and super user
	python manage.py migrate # create database 
	python manage.py createsuperuser # create super user
	
	Username (leave blank to use 'z820'): pavneet # Super user name
	Email address: pghai01@yahoo.com # Super user email
	Password: 123456 # this will be hiden 
	Password (again): 123456 # this will be hiden 
	This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
	This password is too common.
	This password is entirely numeric.
	Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y # this is inbuld validation
	Superuser created successfully.

Step 5 Run Server
	python manage.py runserver # this will run server in your local machine, copy http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and paste/go on web browser
	
Step 6 Run the project
	on any web browser at address bar type
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/ # you will see the running page
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin # to enter in admin panel enter credintials of super user
		Username: pavneet
		Password: 123456
		
		'''
		if you see Authentication and Authorization and user 
		means it good, all done
		'''
Step 7 creating new App (single feature or group, form, blog, etc)
	#drag myproject folder in Visual Studio Code Editor
	
	# go back to cmd and press 
	Ctrl+c # to Quit the server
	in CMD under: django) e:\Pavan\Python\Codes\myproject>
	python manage.py startapp helloworld # helloworld is the app name (can be any name)

Step 8 go to Visual Studio Code editor
	Step-8A under helloworld --> views.py
	# Check helloworld folder is created 
	# within helloworld locate views.py
	# you will see following codes 
		from django.shortcuts import render
		
		# Create your views here.
		# create a msg that returns hello world 
		# return in Http response 
		from django.http import HttpResponse # import Capital H and R 
		
		def hello(request): # We need to connect this function to some URL
			return HttpResponse("Hello World!) # this will return Hello World
			
	Step8B under myproject --- > urls.py # this is to connect out hello function 
		# Add come codes to existing default codes
		
		from helloworld.views import hello # helloworld.views (foldername.filename) import (Functionname)
		
		# under urlpatterns  add list element below that is present
		path('admin/', admin.site.urls), # Already present
		path('',hello), # Newly added , giving '' as this points to index.html default 
		
	'''
	# Check if working
	# go to CMD
	python manage.py runserver
	# go to web browser type 
	127.0.0.1:8000 # Local server address, 
	#You will see 
	# Hello World # this is plan text, if you wish to see as paragraph (Bold) 
	# change in function hello, to do some
	# go to helloworld --> views.py in  hello function 
	# replace return HttpResponse('Hello World!') with 
	return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello World!</h1>') # add html tags 
	
	# Now as the server is already running go to web browser and refresh
	# you will see html in Bold
